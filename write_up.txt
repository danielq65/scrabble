So far in my implementation I’ve manage to get the scrabble board to print on the screen, each slot being its own individual picture. I’ve gotten the rack and tiles to print out as well and I’ve begun messing around with the drag and drop features of jquery. I’ve also started the implementation of my restart button in order to allow the user to get a new hand of 7 tiles whenever they press the button. Right now the restart feature is not working 100% correctly though as its not accounting for the distribution of the letters or the amount of tiles left in the game. The game is a work in progress.
